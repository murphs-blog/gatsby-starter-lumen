I am dead. And I don't feel very good about it. There is no fried chicken here, wherever I am now.

Nothing about being dead is good. I had other expectations about it when I was alive. Now that I am dead, I realize that it is extremely boring... 

There is, however, one interesting thing, funny indeed, that I have been noticing since I died. Suddenly I have become a good person ... 

Ever since I died, people I have left behind have been not only exaggerating the few good things about me but also cooking up stories about me being an amazing person. And the bad things are either forgotten or presented in a way as if they were 'cool'...

I am touched...

I wish I could come back to live with you people once again... And make your life miserable again...so that you don't lie the next time I die.

Relationships are true and honest only when the feelings for you don't change even when you are dead...

The very fact that you are shying away from telling the truth, that I was an asshole, speaks volumes of why I had been so mean with you.

That's what you deserved, you hypocrites. 

And given a chance, I would be mean to you again...
